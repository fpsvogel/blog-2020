# My blog from 2020

See it at https://fpsvogel-2020.netlify.app/

How I built it: https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2020/zs

The first iteration of my programming blog, built with https://github.com/zserge/zs and HTML + CSS from scratch (and a bit of Lua, too).

Replaced by https://github.com/fpsvogel/blog-2021
