So I wake up one day, and sitting right in front of me is an existential crisis. A big, hairy, gnarly one. It says to me, "Hey man, you gotta get your act together. You have five (or six? seven?) to-do lists, constantly out of date and misplaced!? That's not gonna cut it anymore."

Here's how I beat that monster and organized my life with a customized `todo.txt` with VS Code syntax highlighting and a script to add daily, weekly, and monthly recurring tasks automatically. It's plain text, so it's flexible, fast, and easy to sync across my devices.

But first I tried a few popular productivity apps… and immediately gave up on them. Wading through all their features, I missed my old desktop Sticky Notes, despite how numerous and scattered they were. I realized I just needed a way to organize everything in one plain text file.

So then I discovered the venerable [`todo.txt`](http://todotxt.org/) tradition, imbued with that unmistakable musky aroma of Unix geekdom. I loved the idea, but then I found [an even more flexible approach](https://jeffhuang.com/productivity_text_file/) that incorporates appointments *and* a log/journal of notes and completed tasks, so that you don't have to juggle a calendar throughout the day or constantly lose scattered ideas and findings: it's all in your to-do/appointment/journal... thingy.

So in the end, after several other existential crises showing up and accusing me of actually being unproductive in quest of perfect productivity, here's what my `todo.txt` looks like:

<div class="hover-images">
    <img src="/assets/todo-example.png" alt="todo.txt vs code language syntax">
    <img src="/assets/todo-example-annot.png" class="img-hover" alt="todo.txt vs code language syntax">
</div>

Of course, you could lay out your tasks and notes differently according to your taste, but the idea is to color-code different kinds of tasks and metadata—for example, in this implementation:

- <span style="color: #F38D8D">urgent tasks (<code>*</code>) and appointments</span>
- <span style="color: #F3ED72">blocked/waiting tasks (<code>`</code>)</span>
- <span style="color: #6CB6FF">tags (<code>@</code>)</span>
- <span style="color: #C583FA">URLs</span>
- <span style="color: #00FFFF">date headings (<code>##</code>)</span>
- <span style="color: #9E9E9E">notes (<code>></code>)</span>
- <span style="color: #A3A352">quotes or other long text (<code>{...}</code>)</span>

And since it's all just plain text, it's very portable and mobile-friendly: I just keep `todo.txt` synced to cloud storage, and I can edit on the go with a cloud-syncing text editor on my phone.

There were two tricky bits in setting this up: (1) the syntax highlighting, and (2) the script to add recurring tasks. Here are my solutions for those.

## todo.txt syntax highlighting in VS Code

Color-coding my `todo.txt` in VS Code involved a few steps:

1. Figure out a regular expression for each of the items listed above.
2. Package them in a TextMate grammar (`.tmLanguage`) file.
3. Create the VS Code extension using the grammar.
4. Set colors for syntax highlighting in VS Code's `settings.json`.

And here are my results for #2 and #4. First the TextMate grammar:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">

            <string>\B\@\w+</string>
            <key>name</key>
            <string>constant.language.tag.todotxt</string>
        </dict>
        <dict>

            <key>name</key>
            <string>constant.language.subentry.todotxt</string>
        </dict>
        <dict>
            <key>match</key>
            <string>^`.*?(?= @| https?:\/\/| {|$)</string>
            <key>name</key>
            <string>constant.language.waiting.todotxt</string>
        </dict>
        <dict>
            <key>match</key>
            <string>(^\*.*?|^\d[\d: ]{0,5}[ap]m.*?|†.*?)(?= @| https?:\/\/| {|$)</string>
            <key>name</key>
            <string>constant.language.urgent.todotxt</string>
        </dict>
        <dict>
            <key>begin</key>
            <string>{</string>
            <key>end</key>
            <string>}</string>
            <key>name</key>
            <string>constant.language.quote.todotxt</string>
        </dict>
        </array>
        <key>scopeName</key>
        <string>text.todotxt</string>
        <key>uuid</key>

    </dict>
    </plist>

And then the colors in `settings.json`:

    "[todotxt]": {
        "editor.quickSuggestions": false
    },
    "editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
        "textMateRules": [
            {
                "scope": "constant.language.quote.todotxt",
                "settings": {
                    "foreground": "#A3A352"
                }
            },
            {
                "scope": "constant.language.urgent.todotxt",
                "settings": {
                    "foreground": "#F38D8D"
                }
            },
            {
                "scope": "constant.language.waiting.todotxt",
                "settings": {
                    "foreground": "#F3ED72"
                }
            },
            {
                "scope": "constant.language.date.todotxt",
                "settings": {
                    "foreground": "#00FFFF",
                    "fontStyle": "bold underline"
                }
            },
            {
                "scope": "constant.language.subentry.todotxt",
                "settings": {
                    "foreground": "#9e9e9e",
                }
            },
            {
                "scope": "constant.language.url.todotxt",
                "settings": {
                    "foreground": "#C583FA",
                }
            },
            {
                "scope": "constant.language.tag.todotxt",
                "settings": {
                    "foreground": "#6CB6FF"
                }
            },
            {
                "scope": "text.todotxt",
                "settings": {
                    "foreground": "#dbdbdb"
                }
            }
        ]
    }

## Recurring tasks via a script

Here's my `recur.bat` script on Windows. I trust that Linux users need no help writing a shell script, and MacOS users… just ask a Linux friend.

Whenever I need to add or change a recurring task, I simply open up the script and add or change an `echo` line.

    @echo off

    REM script to add daily or weekly recurring tasks to the top of todo.txt

    SET dir=%userprofile%\Dropbox\Apps\SimpleTxtEditor

    REM ******* DAILY RECURRING TASKS *******
    (echo * feed the cat) > %dir%\temp.txt

    REM ******* MONTHLY RECURRING TASKS *******
    SET day=%date:~7,2%

    IF %day%==25 (
    (echo - end of month finances) >> %dir%\temp.txt
    )

    REM ******* WEEKLY RECURRING TASKS *******
    REM set dayofweek to 0-6 (Sunday, Monday, etc.)
    for /f %%a in ('wmic path win32_localtime get dayofweek /format:list ^| findstr "="') do (set %%a)

    REM switch case for days of week
    2>NUL CALL :CASE_%dayofweek%

    REM Sunday
    :CASE_0
        GOTO OUTPUT

    REM Monday
    :CASE_1
        (echo 1pm weekly meeting @work) >> %dir%\temp.txt
        GOTO OUTPUT

    REM Tuesday
    :CASE_2
        GOTO OUTPUT

    REM Wednesday
    :CASE_3
        (echo 7pm dnd) >> %dir%\temp.txt
        GOTO OUTPUT

    REM Thursday
    :CASE_4
        GOTO OUTPUT

    REM Friday
    :CASE_5
        (echo 5:30pm date night) >> %dir%\temp.txt
        GOTO OUTPUT

    REM Saturday
    :CASE_6
        GOTO OUTPUT
    
    :OUTPUT
        type %dir%\todo.txt >> %dir%\temp.txt
        move /y %dir%\temp.txt %dir%\todo.txt
        EXIT

So there you have it. If you ever find yourself face to face with a disorganization-induced existential crisis, now you can set up your own customized `todo.txt` and give your existential crisis (now overwhelmed by your organizing prowess) an existential crisis of its own. Take that, hairy monster!
