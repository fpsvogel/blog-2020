			<h1>Habits and time tracking with aims.md</h1>
			<div class="posttop-subtitle">Beyond a todo list</div>
			<div class="posttop-date">2021-02-28</div>
			<p>Some time ago <a href="/posts/2020-06-13-todotxt.html">I proudly wrote about my new todo.txt</a>. Wellâ€¦ it was less useful than I&rsquo;d hoped. Tasks languished at the top of my todo list for days as I looked at it less and less often amid the bustle of daily life. I already had calendar apps to remind me of appointments, and I was already working regularly (however inconsistently) on side projects without needing to be reminded of them. And so my todo list was sidelined.</p>

<p>The good news is that now I&rsquo;ve discovered something that meshes much better with daily life: a daily checklist of habits and disciplines, with any one-off &ldquo;todo&rdquo; tasks added in. This list I&rsquo;m checking every day, since it consists of things that I was already doing (or wanted to do) on a daily or weekly basis, and so any &ldquo;todo&rdquo; tasks that I throw in are now much more likely to get done as well.</p>

<p>But the real power of this new approach is with those daily and weekly tasks, providing a formal structure that helps me do them more consistently. In school we wouldn&rsquo;t learn much if we didn&rsquo;t have a teacher spurring us on and evaluating our progress. With this new productivity tool, I&rsquo;m playing the role of teacher (or at least taskmaster) to myself. Here&rsquo;s how.</p>

<h2>1. Set up templates</h2>

<p>I have a file <code>aims.md</code> which I edit with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one">Markdown All in One</a> extension for VS Code. More on that in a bit, but at the top of the file I have templates of lists of tasks to be done every week and every day, marked with tags and a time goal (where applicable). Here is a simple example:</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
## THIS WEEK
- [ ] read: latin: 1h   Seneca - Epistulae
- [ ] call parents

## TODAY
### Study
- [ ] code: 1h          readstat
- [ ] read: math: 30m   Calculus II
### Leisure
- [ ] read: 30m         Freeman - Alexander the Great
### Health
- [ ] exercise 40m
- [ ] no knuckle pops
</code></pre>

<h2>2. Get things done</h2>

<p>A bit further down in the file (past a list of &ldquo;todo&rdquo; tasks) is where the real work happens. Each week I copy my weekly tasks (and any one-off &ldquo;todo&rdquo; tasks) and paste them in this lower region, and every morning I similarly copy down my daily tasks, just above yesterday&rsquo;s finished checklist. Here&rsquo;s what it looks like:</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
## THIS WEEK
- [ ] family:           call parents
- [ ] blog:             finish aims.md

## 2021-02-26 - Friday
### Study
- [x] code: 1h          reading tracker
- [ ] read: math: 30m   Calculus II
### Leisure
- [ ] read: 15m/30m         Freeman - Alexander the Great
- [x] read: latin: 1.5h/1h   Seneca - Epistulae
### Health
- [x] exercise 40m
- [ ] no knuckle pops   ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say this is a Friday evening when I found myself with a bit of extra time, so I pulled down my weekly Latin reading into today&rsquo;s checklist, and then went over my goal by half an hourâ€”Seneca is that good. Earlier today I exercised and did my daily coding. Now all that&rsquo;s left is math and leisure reading (of which I&rsquo;ve already done 15 minutes earlier today). I&rsquo;m trying to kick the habit of popping my knuckles, but I caught myself doing that <em>twice</em> today, so I won&rsquo;t be able to check that off. I emphasize (and quantify) my failure with two sad emojis. This weekend I need to call my parents and finish this blog post, and then I can call it a week well spent.</p>

<p>Editing my daily checklist is made convenient by VS Code&rsquo;s <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one">Markdown All in One</a> extension. Headings are colored, a new line in a checklist is filled in with an empty checkbox, and there is a keyboard shortcut for toggling checkboxes. Also, with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree">Todo Tree</a> extension, unchecked boxes are highlighted. Here&rsquo;s what it looks like:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/aims-vscode.png" alt="aims.md todo list in vs code markdown" /></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also convenient to use an app like <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey</a> to set up a keyboard shortcut for inserting the date heading and emojis, though I use the text expander <a href="https://beeftext.org/">Beeftext</a> for emojis and other simple snippets.</p>

<h2>3. Analyze your progress, and improve!</h2>

<p>As you fill out these daily checklists, each morning copying the template and pasting it just above yesterday&rsquo;s list, you&rsquo;ll soon see a record of how you&rsquo;ve done in past days. Scrolling down my own <code>aims.md</code>, I see a patchwork of unfinished tasks and sad emojis mixed in with the successes marked by X&rsquo;s. A mixed record, for sure.</p>

<p>But you know what? After just two months of doing this, I can see an improvement. T are fewer omissions and failures toward the top of the file than near the bottom, which confirms my suspicion that I&rsquo;ve become more consistent through the repeated shame of seeing unchecked boxes and sad emojis at the end of a day when I haven&rsquo;t been focused enough. And the improvement is even better than it appears at first glance, because in my own checklists (not the examples above) I&rsquo;ve actually raised the bar by gradually adding a few more regular tasks to my templates.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also nice to see milestones that I&rsquo;ve reached, which I mark with the <code>â›³ goal:</code> emoji and tag.</p>

<p>Speaking of tags, it wouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to write an app that analyzes this daily record, answering queries such as these:</p>

<ul>
<li>How have I divided up my time, based on tags?</li>
<li>Which tasks are most often left incomplete?</li>
<li>On which days of the week am I most productive?</li>
<li>How has my productivity changed, if I could visualize it over time?</li>
</ul>

<p>Not a bad idea for a future projectâ€¦</p>
